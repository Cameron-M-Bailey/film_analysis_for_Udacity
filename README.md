# Film_Analysis_for_Udacity

# Installation

# Project Motivation
As a movie buff, I was interested in analyzing what determines the success of a film. I was interested in exploring: 
<p>- Adjusted for inflation do most movies breakeven?
<p>- Are movie runtimes significantly increasing and is it impacting viewer reviews?
<p>- Is there a relationship between the budget and revenue or movie popularity?
<p>- Is it possible to forecast revenue with the data provided? </p>

# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available that analyzes the data using the objectives stated above. The notebook includes explortary data analysis, correlation analysis, and trained linear regression model to predict movie revenues. 
# Results
